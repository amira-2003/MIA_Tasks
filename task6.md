Q:
We need to design a Software Practical Low Pass Filter (LPF) what is the proper cutoff frequency (fc) If WALL-E has Specs:

Encoder has 540 pulse per revolution

Track has three wheels only one motorized, with 40cm diameter, (The one that has encoder)

And Maximum speed of WALL-E 0.5 m/s

ANSWER: speed(rpm) = (60/2*3.14*0.2)*0.5 = 23.885 RPM 
fc = (23.885 * 540) / 60 = 214.965 Hz = 0.215KHz
