# MIA_tasks
MIA_tasks includes electrical  tasks of different branches hardware and software.

## task1:
includes implementing c/c++ program for diffrent requirments

1.TASK1.1: Hello Gru :  prints the string ‘GRU’ in the output terminal (console) (Hello World problem).

2.TASK1.2: Counting Down : takes the number to start the countdown from as input and prints the countdown text starting from that number.

3.TASK1.3: Task Manager : allows users to add, view, and remove tasks, each task has an id/index and a description. The id is a positive unique integer.

4.TASK1.4: Kalman Missile : t takes two sensor measurements (just two arrays) and generates only one new array measurement with any averaging method, such as Kalman Filter.

## task2:
includes 2 circuit designs, one for H-bridge and other for practicing on circuit basics,diodes and its applications, there is also last talks which depends on the power supply and capacity of batteries.

1.TASK1.1: Lightning the Dark : a design for a circuit takes 220V AC as input and the output is 5VDC and connects LED to the output 

2.TASK1.2: Air Extraction to Fan : a simple design  H-bridge driver to control the direction of the DC motor using transistors.

3.TASK1.3: Box of Shame : is a simple design that indicates how many batteries needed for specific volt and capacity required for specific circuit design.

## Task3_Steal_Shrink_Ray_Gun:
TASK3.1: Signal to Engage
